[TSGL](https://github.com/Calvin-CS/TSGL) - A thread-safe graphics library perfect for drawing graphics. You can do a wide variety of things with TSGL, including: image manipulation and rendering (.bmp, .jpeg, and .png image formats supported), 2D polygon drawing (rectangles, circles, triangles, etc.), text rendering, animations with keyboard and/or mouse events, and much more. All drawing and rendering is done with threads and in parallel.

[TSAL](https://github.com/Calvin-CS/TSAL) - A Thread Safe Audio Library that uses audiolizations to assist in the understanding of concurrent and parallel processing.
